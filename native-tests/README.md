# App-screen native tests

These tests exercise the product's plain WebViews. They do not sign in to any
real service, use provider/DB/SSO credentials, or qualify distribution.

## Desktop GTK runtime fixture

On Linux with the Tauri GTK/WebKit SDK, Xvfb, xdotool, Python and OpenSSL, build
and run the executable fixture:

```bash
cp src-tauri/Cargo.lock src-tauri/plugins/app-screen/Cargo.lock
cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri/plugins/app-screen/Cargo.toml --features desktop-fixture --example desktop-profile-probe
python3 native-tests/desktop/run.py --binary src-tauri/plugins/app-screen/target/debug/examples/desktop-profile-probe --data /absolute/new/disposable-directory
```

Use a new absolute disposable data path. If using `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, pass that
build's example binary instead. The runner creates a temporary loopback HTTPS
server and test-only certificate, then launches write and new-process readback
under isolated Xvfb/D-Bus sessions. Certificate trust is scoped to that test
view's context; no certificate is installed in the OS or product settings.
The fixture explicitly fails without its expected observations, including on
timeout. It uses the production raw-view
factory and synthetic HTML with https base URIs, checks cookies/localStorage
across two profiles/two sites and a separate legacy jar, absence of Tauri and
Wry messaging on GTK, same-screen reuse, retarget refusal and picker return.
Storage reads wait for an exact document URL and DOM nonce; an earlier page's
load event cannot start them. The regression deliberately finishes a previous
document first. A separate missing-document process must time out with no
storage observation. Each cookie/storage assertion runs once after readiness;
incorrect data is never retried. Native evaluation errors retain WebKit's error.
It also checks committed-origin display, pending/cancelled and iframe navigation,
native Back despite a page override, and native-keyboard-triggered popup creation,
profile/opener inheritance and script-close cleanup. Process readback concerns
settled writes after orderly teardown, not last-write durability or crash recovery.
This qualifies the GTK adapter's synthetic behavior; it is not Windows/macOS,
real IdP, file operations or distribution evidence.

## Android

The Android fixture builds the actual `app-screen` plugin and its pinned Tauri
Android API without generating the full app or requiring Firebase configuration.
Set `TAURI_ANDROID_SOURCE` to `mobile/android` in the tauri crate selected by
`src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, use the installed Android SDK/JDK 17 and Gradle 8.14.3:

```bash
gradle --project-dir native-tests/android :app-screen:testDebugUnitTest :app-screen:assembleDebugAndroidTest
# With a test device/emulator attached:
gradle --project-dir native-tests/android :app-screen:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

`ProfileIsolationTest` runs in an actual Android WebView. It writes synthetic
cookies and localStorage to two https origins using `loadDataWithBaseURL`, with
no network request to those sites. It checks two profiles at the same site,
two sites in one profile, recreated/evicted views, popup profile inheritance,
legacy shared-store preservation and rejection of a live view's profile change.
It also checks that those pages have no Tauri IPC. An engine without
`MULTI_PROFILE` fails the qualification test; it is not silently skipped.
The popup assertion calls the production registry factory; it does not trigger
the full `window.open`/WebView transport callback or an OAuth flow.

CI runs the JVM tests and instrumentation APK compile, then these engine tests
on a disposable Android emulator. Device/IdP login, file operations and updates
remain separate checks. Reports live under the ignored plugin `android/build/`.

The Swift policy suite runs on Linux CI via:

```bash
swift test --package-path src-tauri/plugins/app-screen/ios/PolicyTests
```

That suite verifies navigation and canonical profile names, not UIKit rendering
or iOS data-store isolation. WKWebView/device qualification remains necessary.
