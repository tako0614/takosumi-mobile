# Standalone browser-foundation candidate

Experimental Linux CEF 154 process using the App's production `OpenRequest`
validator and UUID profile IDs. It does not replace the Tauri runtime or change
installed App profiles. See [upstream attribution and scope](UPSTREAM.md).

Build with an owned SDK/target directory and the committed candidate lockfile:

```bash
CEF_PATH=/absolute/owned/sdk CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/absolute/owned/target cargo build --locked --manifest-path native-tests/cef-candidate/Cargo.toml
python3 -B native-tests/cef-candidate/run.py --binary /absolute/owned/target/debug/takosumi-cef-candidate --data /absolute/new/case --app photopea
```

The first build downloads a separate CEF SDK. Check available storage first; do
not use the product's Cargo target, install shared OS packages or alter the App
lockfile. The executable needs its adjacent SDK libraries/resources. The runner
sets its library search path, creates a private HOME/XDG/Xvfb/D-Bus session and
uses the existing pidfd browser guard. Node 24+, Python, Xvfb, D-Bus, `timeout`
and ImageMagick `convert` must already be available. Only anonymous Photopea and
Excalidraw roots and generated files are allowed; no real accounts or cloud save.
Use a short `--data` path: the pinned Linux Chromium's temporary singleton
socket must fit `sockaddr_un`. The runner rejects an oversized path before
allocating a case or starting the browser; it does not relocate profile data.

Default `--files cdp` uses a headless browser except in the permission modes
below. It supplies the site's actual
existing file input through CDP and sets `allowAndName` for an owned download
directory. Success requires the actual selected page's download GUID/frame,
native completion, decoded exported data, no remote native IPC globals and
normal CEF shutdown with no remaining child. Photopea's PNG must contain the
fixture's dimensions and red/blue pixels. This is a component check, with the
OS chooser and default Save UI unqualified.

`--mode inspect` records observations and never qualifies an operation.
`--app excalidraw --files native-picker` is a separate visible-browser probe of
the actual File System Access Open and Save As choosers; it additionally needs existing `xdotool`
and ImageMagick `import`. Its experimental English GTK dialog driver must fail
when the expected unique dialog/focus/closure is missing. It does not disable
Web APIs or substitute another input route after a failed operation. Retain the
failed case rather than inferring engine incapability from an automation error.
The driver waits for the rendered confirm label in the inspected GTK theme
before clicking once, and replaces the entire filename including its extension.
This pixel heuristic is specific to that theme/geometry. A red canvas is only
import readiness; success requires the exact new owned Save As output, the
case-specific scene nonce and the actual keyboard edit. A toast or a file saved
under an unexpected name cannot pass. This path does not require a download
event because File System Access writes through the selected native file handle.

`source.json` and `source-snapshot/` retain the runner, driver, export oracle and
cleanup validators; `execution.json` also checks their hashes, the executable
and `libcef.so` after the session. `reference.json` contains the component result.
Every qualifying mode requires `execution.passed`. `operate` also requires
`reference.operationPassed`. Both profile modes require `reference.profilePassed`; `profile-popup` additionally
requires `reference.popupPassed`. Inspect never qualifies a capability. All
success flags also require root exit 0, no remaining child and no forced cleanup.
`site-permissions` requires `reference.profilePassed` and
`reference.permissionPassed` as well as `execution.passed`.
`permission-inspect` never qualifies a permission or notification capability.
`site-notifications` additionally requires `reference.notificationUiPassed`;
`reference.pushPassed` is always false in these local probes.

## Native profiles and popup primitive

```bash
python3 -B native-tests/cef-candidate/run.py --binary /absolute/owned/target/debug/takosumi-cef-candidate --data /absolute/new/profile-case --app photopea --mode profiles
python3 -B native-tests/cef-candidate/run.py --binary /absolute/owned/target/debug/takosumi-cef-candidate --data /absolute/new/popup-case --app photopea --mode profile-popup
```

These modes create two explicit UUID request contexts in one native process;
they do not use CDP context/target creation as a replacement. Native BrowserHost
cache-path readback is joined to the actual page through native and CDP main
frame IDs. Native DevTools registrations live until their browser closes. The
binding is captured after the first main-frame load: an early inspection target
may still have type `other`. URL, target order or configured paths alone do not
qualify a binding. Unknown multi-profile Chrome-UI windows receive a close-only
client, rather than an unmanaged window or an inferred profile.

The test writes a case-specific localStorage key and synthetic Secure/HttpOnly
cookies into the fresh contexts. Cookie setup uses CDP, not a server login.
Wrong state fails on its single read; only lifecycle/readiness metadata is
polled. Actual native close callbacks and target disappearance precede retained
state checks in the surviving profile.

`profile-popup` drives standard `window.open` / `window.close` through CDP
`Runtime.evaluate(userGesture: true)`. It checks native profile/cache/frame and
browser-context inheritance, the actual target's opener, JS opener presence and
absence of native messaging globals. The child reads Work state, writes new
synthetic state, closes, and its still-live parent reads the new state while
Personal remains separate. It does not qualify a real click, OS focus, popup
blocking policy, cross-origin/provider authentication or login completion.

## Default site permission UI

```bash
python3 -B native-tests/cef-candidate/run.py --binary /absolute/owned/target/debug/takosumi-cef-candidate --data /absolute/new/permission-case --app excalidraw --mode site-permissions
TMPDIR=/absolute/owned/tmp node --test native-tests/cef-candidate/permissions.test.mjs
```

`permission-inspect` only requests notification permission and retains the
native screenshot and state. `site-permissions` exercises Chrome's existing
Allow/Block UI in a visible owned Xvfb session. Both modes additionally need
existing `xdotool` and ImageMagick `import`. A generated document title binds
the actual page to a unique visible window whose PID must equal the owned
native process. Each window is placed in the inspected geometry, with both
CDP and X11 geometry readback. The click coordinates are specific to this
English Linux build and the separately inspected single-line Excalidraw and
wrapped Photopea prompt layouts; this is not a portable prompt driver.

The standard permission request uses CDP's synthetic userGesture, but the
decision uses one native UI click. No permission handler, site API replacement
or CDP grant is installed. Before every choice the request must still be
pending without error at the original secure origin. All permission samples
must retain that bound origin. Work's Allow must resolve to granted while
Personal remains prompt; Personal's Block must resolve to denied while Work
remains granted. The five replay controls reject wrong/insecure sites,
redirected requests and pre-resolved or redirected pre-click snapshots before
any native click; they are oracle tests, not native capability evidence.

On 2026-11-05 Excalidraw passed the choices, state separation and normal CEF
shutdown. Photopea's initial probe showed its real prompt, and an earlier
partial run granted Work while Personal remained prompt, but its complete
final flow is unqualified. Window-cascade/layout and cold-start failures are
retained. Permission revocation, restart persistence and other permission
types are still unfinished.

The permitted notification constructor emitted `show`, while the denied
profile emitted `error`. The owned session nevertheless reported a missing
`org.freedesktop.Notifications` service. A session also printed an unattributed
`free(): invalid pointer` outside the CEF log; normal CEF exit does not qualify
the entire desktop service stack. `notificationPassed` remains false: a page
event is insufficient for OS display, actual Push delivery, click or resume.

## Owned native notification backend

```bash
python3 -B native-tests/cef-candidate/run.py --binary /absolute/owned/target/debug/takosumi-cef-candidate --data /absolute/new/notification-case --app photopea --mode site-notifications --notification-daemon /absolute/owned/dunst
TMPDIR=/absolute/owned/tmp node --test native-tests/cef-candidate/notifications.test.mjs
```

This explicit mode needs an already available Dunst 1.12.2 executable, `gdbus`,
`dbus-monitor`, X11/XRes 1.2 libraries, `xdotool` and ImageMagick `import`. It
starts that real daemon only in the runner's fresh private D-Bus/Xvfb session;
it neither registers an installed App service nor changes shared OS packages.
The executable hash is recorded and checked after the run. The backend's real
D-Bus owner PID and XRes server resource-owner PID must match the owned daemon.
It preserves normal tag/replacement handling and uses one visible plus one
waiting notification. The page API and desktop signals are never substituted.

Both native UUID contexts receive an actual Allow choice in Chrome's existing
notification prompt. Generated standard page Notifications use the same tag
on the same origin, with different Work/Personal titles. Success would require
coexistence, live page objects, native screenshots/input, trusted clicks only
in the original profile, actual desktop action signals and native closure.
Before each click the other owned browser window must have focus; only the
page's standard onclick `window.focus()` may restore its own window. The test
does not repair focus through CDP or X11 after the click. Network Push,
Service Worker background delivery and closed-App resume are separate.

The 2026-11-05 two-profile checks **failed**. Excalidraw's visible Work alert
produced a native action for its desktop notification ID, but Personal received
the callback. After strengthening state capture and the focus precondition,
Photopea failed before clicking: Personal's same-tag creation had already
closed Work's JS notification object while its OS alert remained displayed.
Both CEF guards and owned daemons shut down normally; these are functional
failures, with `notificationUiPassed` and `execution.passed` false. Four replay
controls reject wrong-profile callbacks, closed page objects, foreign X11
owners and an already-focused target; they are not native evidence.

The matching Chromium source uses origin plus the non-persistent notification
token as the ID; a nonempty tag becomes that token. Its process-wide listener
registry replaces entries by this ID. This is consistent with the observed
collision across isolated contexts. A future adapter must preserve profile
identity before this listener boundary, or evaluate separate browser processes
per profile. Merely routing the OS action by profile cannot recreate an already
replaced listener. No such fix, engine replacement or App integration is made
by this fixture; the same-tag failure must remain a required regression.

On 2026-11-05 the basic same-origin profile test and the synthetic popup flow
passed on native CEF, including normal closure. Earlier popup runs passed the
functional assertions but failed shutdown and remain failures. Milestones
located a recorder EOF wait after SDK shutdown/client release; the recorder now
ends on the explicit runtime-complete boundary and is still joined. This does
not establish that all retained SDK references or cold-start issues are solved.

## Observations and limits

On 2026-11-05 the native candidate loaded Photopea, imported its generated SVG,
saved and decoded a 138-byte 128×96 PNG and shut down normally. The original
private driver and the public runner each passed separately. Excalidraw also
passed actual native Open, import, keyboard edit and native Save As to the exact
new output, with the nonce and edited geometry verified in a 961-byte scene and
normal shutdown. Earlier headless chooser, disabled-confirm, title-readiness
and doubled-extension failures remain failures. Some cold starts stopped at
about:blank with incomplete guard cleanup; kernel I/O waits were observed and
the retained PIDs were later absent. Their unique cause remains unresolved.
These successful file operations do not establish daily-use reliability.

The native browser reports non-global request contexts whose cache paths equal
the requested UUID directories. Same-origin synthetic storage/cookie separation
and the popup primitive do not establish permission isolation, restart
persistence or real authentication. Tauri UI integration, real login/popup
return, other site permissions/revocation, Web Push delivery, sandboxing, other OSes,
updates and distribution remain unfinished. The runner
uses `no_sandbox` in its disposable root test environment; it is not a release
configuration or an engine-selection decision.
